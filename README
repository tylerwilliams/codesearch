Code Search is a tool for indexing and then performing
regular expression searches over large bodies of source code.
It is a set of command-line programs written in Go.

This version of codesearch is based on the original version
github.com/google/codesearch, by Russ Cox.

It's mostly an experiment with maintaining the search index
in pebble (github.com/cockroachdb/pebble), an LSMT, but also
in serving and scoring in different ways.
